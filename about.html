        My Hobby
    </h2>
    My favorite sport to watch is basketball. My favorite basketball player to watch is Luka Dončić. He is from Slovenia and currently plays for the Dallas Mavericks.
    Before joining the National Basketball Association, he played three seasons for the EuroLeague's Real Madrid at only sixteen years old. He made an immediate impact his first year and he earned the NBA Rookie of Year awarind in 2019. He has played 6 seasons with the Dallas Mavericks. He has averaged 28 points per game. He looks to have a promising career.
